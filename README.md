# Role-Aware-Semantic-Vector-Framework
A Role-Aware Semantic Vector Framework that analyzes text by combining syntactic structure with a new method for deep, contextual word embedding. Inspired by neuroscience research, this approach uses "pole words" to map out multi-dimensional semantic space, generating distinct embeddings for words as "head" and "modifier" roles.
